This is a sample text file for testing purposes.
It contains multiple lines, characters, words, and different types of content.

Numbers are also included: 12345, 67890, 13579, and some special characters !@#$%^&*().

Here's a line with punctuation... does it work?

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The file should include:
- Short words like I, am, he, on.
- Longer words such as 'parameter', 'assessment', and 'characterization'.

And a few VERY long words:
- pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (45 letters)
	Coined in 1935 by then-president of the National Puzzlers' League, Everett M. Smith.
- antidisestablishmentarianism (28 letters)

Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
